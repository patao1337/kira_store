# Admin Panel Documentation

This document provides an overview of the admin panel implementation in the kiâ€¢ra e-commerce platform.

## Overview

The admin panel provides a secure interface for administrators to manage products and categories. It includes:

- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Category management (CRUD operations)
- Authentication and authorization controls

## Access Control

The admin panel is protected by authentication and authorization checks:

1. Users must be logged in to access the admin panel
2. Users must have admin privileges, determined by the `is_admin` field in the profiles table

To make a user an admin, run the following SQL function:
```sql
SELECT promote_to_admin('user-uuid-here');
```

## Database Schema

The admin panel requires several database tables and security policies, all of which are included in the main `schema.sql` file. Key components include:

1. The `is_admin` field in the `profiles` table
2. Row-Level Security (RLS) policies that allow admins to perform CRUD operations
3. Utility functions to promote/demote admin users
