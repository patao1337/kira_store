# Admin Panel Documentation

This document provides an overview of the admin panel implementation in the kiâ€¢ra e-commerce platform.

## Overview

The admin panel provides a secure interface for administrators to manage products and categories. It includes:

- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Category management (CRUD operations)
- Image upload functionality for products
- Authentication and authorization controls

## Access Control

The admin panel is protected by authentication and authorization checks:

1. Users must be logged in to access the admin panel
2. Users must have admin privileges, determined by the `is_admin` field in the profiles table

To make a user an admin, run the following SQL function:
```sql
SELECT promote_to_admin('user-uuid-here');
```

## Database Schema

The admin panel requires several database tables and security policies, all of which are included in the main `schema.sql` file. Key components include:

1. The `is_admin` field in the `profiles` table
2. Row-Level Security (RLS) policies that allow admins to perform CRUD operations
3. Storage buckets and policies for image uploads
4. Utility functions to promote/demote admin users

## Storage Setup

The admin panel uses Supabase Storage for image uploads. To set up storage for product images, run the following SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create storage bucket for product images
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) VALUES ('products', 'products', true);

-- Create storage policy for product images - publicly accessible
CREATE POLICY "Product images are publicly accessible" 
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT 
  USING (bucket_id = 'products');

-- Allow admins to upload product images
CREATE POLICY "Admins can upload product images" 
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'products' AND 
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() AND profiles.is_admin = TRUE
    )
  );

-- Allow admins to update product images
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update product images" 
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE 
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'products' AND 
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() AND profiles.is_admin = TRUE
    )
  );

-- Allow admins to delete product images
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete product images" 
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE 
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'products' AND 
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() AND profiles.is_admin = TRUE
    )
  );
```

## Implementation Details

The admin panel is built using:

- Next.js App Router for routing
- Client Components with React hooks for state management
- Supabase for data storage, authentication, and file storage
- ShadCN UI components for the interface

## Routes

- `/admin` - Main admin dashboard with tabs for products and categories
- `/admin/products/new` - Form to create a new product
- `/admin/products/[id]` - Form to edit an existing product
- `/admin/categories/new` - Form to create a new category
- `/admin/categories/[id]` - Form to edit an existing category

## Components

Key components include:

- `ProductList.tsx` - Displays all products in a table with action buttons
- `CategoryList.tsx` - Displays all categories in a table with action buttons
- `ProductForm.tsx` - Form for creating and editing products with image upload functionality
- `CategoryForm.tsx` - Form for creating and editing categories

## Services

The admin functionality is powered by these service functions:

- `createProduct()` - Creates a new product
- `updateProduct()` - Updates an existing product
- `deleteProduct()` - Deletes a product
- `getFullProductById()` - Gets complete product details for editing
- `createCategory()` - Creates a new category
- `deleteCategory()` - Deletes a category

## Technical Details

### Image Upload Process

1. **File Selection**: Users select images using HTML file input elements
2. **Preview**: Selected images are immediately previewed using `URL.createObjectURL()`
3. **Upload**: On form submission, files are uploaded to Supabase Storage
4. **Naming**: Files are renamed with timestamp and random component to avoid conflicts
5. **URL Generation**: Public URLs are generated and stored in the database
6. **Database Update**: Product records are updated with new image URLs

### Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- File upload failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid file formats
- Storage permission errors
- Database update failures
